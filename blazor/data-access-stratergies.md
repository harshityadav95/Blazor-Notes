# Data Access Stratergies

*  **REST** or **RESTful API** design \(Representational State Transfer\) is designed to take advantage of existing protocols. While **REST** can be used over nearly any protocol, it usually takes advantage of HTTP. 
* We will be building the RESTful service using ASP.NET Core MVC. Since the RESTful service will be running server-side on a .NET core enabled server we will have access to all server-side resources and data including the capability to run Entity Framework Core code.
